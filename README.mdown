# Haxcessibility

Haxcessibility is, above all, a horrible pun on Mac OS X’s Accessibility framework and its AX prefix. I am shameless.

It also enables hacks like moving and resizing another app’s windows.


# Use it

	[HAXSystem element].focusedApplication.focusedWindow.size = NSMakeRect(0, 0, 2560, 1440);

More features are, obviously, desirable.
